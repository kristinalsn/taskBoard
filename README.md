# My Task Board

A full stack project by Christina Lisunov, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## About

The application is a digital task board that allows users to add and manage their tasks with ease. Users can enter a task and a due date. The task is then displayed on the task board. Each task can also be easily deleted when completed.

## Features

1. Add Task: Users can input a task and set a due date.

2. Display Task: Tasks are displayed as sticky notes on a board. 

3. Delete Task: Tasks can be deleted when completed.

4. Data persistence: Tasks are saved in the local storage, so even if the browser is closed or refreshed, the tasks will still be there.

## How to use

Simply input a task in the provided text field, set a due date, and click 'Add Note'. Your task will then appear as a sticky note on the task board.



## Setup

This project runs on any web browser. Simply download or clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## Future improvements

1. Add an edit feature to update existing tasks.
2. Implement user accounts to allow multiple users to manage their tasks independently.
